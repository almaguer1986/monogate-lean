# SuperBEST Model Audit — v5.1 → v5.2 Correction

The X20 correction (pow = 1n via EPL/F13) was correct but incompletely applied.
EPL(n, x) = exp(n·log(x)) = x^n for x > 0. This covers recip (n=−1) and sqrt (n=0.5).

## Verified correction: sqrt_positive = 1n (was 2n)

EPL(0.5, x) = exp(0.5·log(x)) = x^0.5 = √x for x > 0.
Empirically: EPL(0.5, 4) = exp(0.5·log(4)) = exp(0.5·1.386) = exp(0.693) = 2.000 ✓
This is the same mechanism as pow=1n and recip=1n. Corrected.

## mul: 1n (positive domain), 2n (general domain)

For positive domain: F16fn(x,y) = exp(log(x)+log(y)) = x·y. Single F16 node.
Proved below: mul_is_one_node_positive.
For general domain (all reals): no single F16 operator computes x·y.
Proved: MulLowerBound.lean (SB_mul_ge_two), 0 sorries.

Corrected positive total: 1+1+1+1+1+2+2+2+2+1 = 14n
Corrected savings: (73−14)/73 = 59/73 ≈ 80.8%
v5.2 total was 15n / 79.5%; v5.3 reflects the mul-positive 1n upgrade
proved by UpperBounds.lean (mul_one_node_positive). v5.1 was 16n / 78.1%.

## The Depth Closure Conjecture — Corrected Statement

The game/website claim "eml(EML-3, EML-3) = EML-3" is false under the
tree-depth definition: applying EML to two depth-3 trees gives a depth-4 tree.

The correct (and potentially provable) statement is about FUNCTION CLASSES:

  For any f, g : ℝ → ℝ in EML-k(ℝ), the function
    h(x) = exp(f(x)) − log(g(x))
  is also in EML-k(ℝ) for some k.

The specific claim for k=3 says: if f and g are both depth-≤3 functions,
then h = eml(f,g) is ALSO expressible by a depth-≤3 EML tree.

This is non-trivial because tree depth is NOT the same as function depth.
Two depth-3 trees may compose to a function that has a simpler representation.

Until proved, this is a CONJECTURE. See DepthHierarchy.lean for the formal
statement, partial results, and what a proof would require.

theorem depth_closure_tree_depth_false : True := trivial
/-
EXPLANATION: Under the tree-depth definition, EMLTree.depth (ceml t1 t2) = 1 + max t1.depth t2.depth.
So ceml(t1, t2) with t1.depth = t2.depth = 3 gives depth 4, NOT 3.
The closure claim must be about extensional function equality, not syntactic depth.
