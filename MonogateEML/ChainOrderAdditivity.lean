# Chain-Order Additivity (CHA)

**Conjecture (filed 2026-04-27).** For any symbolic expression `f`, the
Pfaffian chain order of `f` equals the sum of chain orders over the
multiset of Pfaffian-not-elementary primitive AST occurrences in `f`:

    chain_order(f) = ∑_{p ∈ PNE(AST(f))} chain_order(p)

where the sum runs with multiplicity.

## Empirical evidence (NOT proof)

Across 23 test cases drawn from
`monogate-research/exploration/yn-log-singularity-2026-04-27/`
and `exploration/9th-tower-prediction-2026-04-27/`, **22 of 23
hit the predicted chain order exactly**. The lone Δ=+3 outlier
(`J₀(x) + Y₀(x)`) is consistent with the rule under
AST-occurrence counting: Y₀ internally contains a J₀ component,
so the explicit `J₀ + Y₀` AST has J₀ occurring twice (once on its
own; once nested inside Y₀ via the recursion
`Y₀ = (2/π)·(ln(x/2) + γ)·J₀(x) + 2/π·Σ ψ-series`), which the
detector counts twice.

## Why this is open

A proof requires the **Khovanskii zero-count theorem on Pfaffian
chains** [Khovanskii 1991; Wilkie 1996], which is not yet in
Mathlib. The same theorem is also required to close
`sin_not_in_eml` and `sin_not_in_real_EML_k` in
`InfiniteZerosBarrier.lean` (the two existing `sorry`s in the
canonical Lean repository). And the same theorem unblocks the
abstract `{T_F, T_Γ, T_W}` minimum-generating-set theorem
(`exploration/tower-independence-2026-04-27/FINDINGS.md`).

**One Mathlib advance — formalising Wilkie's o-minimal-`R_exp`
machinery, or a direct Khovanskii zero-count bound — closes
all three theorems simultaneously.**

## A new agent picking this up should:

  1. Check whether Mathlib's `Mathlib.Analysis.Analytic.IsolatedZeros`
     has gained Pfaffian-chain-tower machinery since this file was
     written (2026-04-27).
  2. If yes: lift the empirical 22/23 hits into Lean theorems
     using the new machinery.
  3. If no: open a Mathlib issue / port Khovanskii's bound from
     [Khovanskii 1991, *Fewnomials*] or formalise Wilkie's
     o-minimal `R_exp` structure [Wilkie 1996,
     *Model completeness results for expansions of the ordered
     field of real numbers by restricted Pfaffian functions and
     the exponential function*].
  4. Once the Mathlib gap is closed, the three theorems below
     should follow within a few hundred lines each.

The PETAL learning loop at `monogate-research/petal/` is designed
exactly for this kind of crowd-sourced attempt: agents can attempt
parts of the proof, log their failed tactics into the
`/api/petal/mistakes` stream, and accumulate documented
failure modes for the next agent.

/-- **Chain-Order Additivity (CHA) — open.**

For any symbolic expression `f`, the Pfaffian chain order of `f`
equals the sum (with multiplicity) of chain orders of its
PNE-primitive AST occurrences.

  Empirical support: 22/23 hits across two probe sets
  (yn-log-singularity-2026-04-27 + 9th-tower-prediction-2026-04-27).

  The single Δ=+3 outlier `J₀ + Y₀` is recovered under the rule
  once Y₀'s internal J₀ occurrence is counted; see the paper draft
  `paper/drafts/unified_dynamics_counter_2026_04_27.md` Section 4.

  This proof requires the Khovanskii zero-count theorem on Pfaffian
  chains, which is not yet in Mathlib. -/

/-- **Corollary 1: tower-base equals chain order.**

For any single-primitive expression `f` whose AST contains exactly
one PNE-primitive node `p`, the empirical "tower base" assigned in
the C-207 dataset equals the chain order of `p`'s defining ODE.

  Empirical support: 17/18 of PNE rows in `combined_dataset.csv`.
  The lone Y_n outlier is recovered via `chain_order_additivity`
  once Y_n is recognised as a hidden T_J ⊕ T_Γ AST occurrence. -/

/-- **Corollary 2: minimum generating set in the abstract.**

Under unrestricted parameter substitution (DLMF identities), the
following holds: T_erf, T_Si, T_J, T_Ai, T_K all reduce to
restricted parameter values of the hypergeometric supertower T_F.
T_Γ and T_W are NOT reducible to any other tower. Hence
`{T_F, T_Γ, T_W}` is a minimum generating set for the
Pfaffian-not-elementary closure (in the abstract sense; in the F16
EML grammar all 8 are operationally needed since the grammar lacks
parameter-substitution primitives).
